### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

My name is **Jean-Michel** and I am an engineer working primarily on energy and power systems.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working to support the development of [long-term, resilient power sector plans](https://www.ccreee.org/irrp/) for Caribbean countries.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m interested in **sustainable energy**, **planning** for power systems, power system **risk** and **resilience**, **resource adequacy**, and research and applications at the intersection of **climate**, **meteorology** and renewable energy.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently strengthening my expertise in wind energy through a [Master in Wind Energy programme](https://lifelonglearning.dtu.dk/en/wind-energy/master-en/wind-energy-master-online-programme/) at the [Technical University of Denmark (DTU)](https://www.dtu.dk/english/).
- âš¡ I'm also upgrading my technical skills in **SQL**, **Python** and **statistics** to support my interests and future career goals.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to energy in the Caribbean!
